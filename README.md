# trello-extract-as-list
Extract the Trello board as a list using the console on the page.  

Labels will be extracted as hashtags (useful for extracting to WorkFlowy for example).

Save the code to html file and voila!

Good starting point if you also want to extract task description, comments, deadline etc.
